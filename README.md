Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize health-related data to identify factors 
contributing to heart attack risk. By using Microsoft Power BI, the project aims to transform 
complex medical and lifestyle data into simple, interactive dashboards. These dashboards allow 
users to explore how different variables — such as age, gender, stress level, BMI, diabetes, and 
smoking habits — influence the likelihood of heart attacks.
This approach helps healthcare professionals, researchers, and policy-makers to make 
informed decisions, increase awareness, and promote preventive healthcare by identifying highrisk individuals and patterns within the data.
Scope
The scope of this project includes the exploration of a structured heart health dataset 
using Power BI. The dataset contains over 25 features including demographic, clinical, and 
behavioral attributes. Using Power BI’s visualization tools, the project covers the creation of 
multiple dashboards that display trends, distributions, and correlations between health indicators 
and heart attack risk.
The project is limited to the data available and focuses on visual analysis rather than 
predictive modelling. It does not provide medical diagnoses but serves as a tool to support 
awareness and data-driven observation. It also demonstrates the capability of Power BI as a 
platform for healthcare data exploration and interactive reporting.
